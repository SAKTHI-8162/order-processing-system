# Order Processor (Java)

A simplified, event-driven order processing system simulating an e‑commerce backend.

## How to run

```bash
# 1) Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed.
cd order-processor
mvn -q -e package

# 2) Run with bundled sample events
java -jar target/order-processor-1.0.0.jar src/main/resources/sample-events.jsonl
```

## Project notes

- Events are ingested from a JSON Lines file (one event per line).
- Jackson is used to parse JSON into concrete event classes based on `eventType`.
- `EventProcessor` updates order state and notifies observers.
- Observers included:
  - `LoggerObserver` – prints processed events and status transitions.
  - `AlertObserver` – prints an alert whenever a status changes (and on cancellation events).
- Order supports **PARTIALLY_PAID** via `amountPaid` tracking.
